  This application is being created for me <br>
  redeem myself from a <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> challenge that I did recently and did not do very well. 😅
</p>
</br>
</br>

# Flutter
<p>This is a responsive <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> app, designed for devices with different screen sizes and types of interaction and it uses <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/hive" target="_blank">Hive</a> to store data locally.</p>
</br>

# SWAPI
<p>This application uses <a href="https://swapi.dev/" target="_blank">swapi.dev</a> to fill in its data. This application can show "planets, spaceships, vehicles, characters, movies, species" and their respective interactions.</p>
</br>

# Hive Database
<p>It saves this data using the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/hive" target="_blank">Hive</a>, it is a "NoSQL database fast, pleasant and secure", I chose this database because it is "Cross platform: mobile, desktop, browser".</p>
</br>

# Choose your side(theme)
<p>You can choose your favorite theme to enjoy the App</p>

# Images
<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/CaioMouraSud/starwarswiki/blob/main/lib/app/utils/image_generator.dart">class</a> to link photos about everything within this application, because StarWars without photos is not the same.</p>
</br>

# Screenshots
<p>This is the first part of the application running on an iOS Emulator and MacOS App</p>
